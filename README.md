# vmss-csc-problems
Problems from the VMSS CSC Judge.

Every problem is packaged in the DOMJudge problem format in their respective folders.

The problem statement is `problem.pdf`. Test cases are located in the `data` subdirectory. Public test cases are located in `sample` while secret testcases are located in `secret`. Files with a `.in` extension are input files while files with a `.ans` extension are the expected output.
